# Introduction

This package was based on a blog post a read on r-bloggers.com [see](https://www.r-bloggers.com/creating-corporate-colour-palettes-for-ggplot2/). When I was making this package I also had a look at ggthemes.

I hope that I found now some nice colors and also want to create a nice theme for CPM.
